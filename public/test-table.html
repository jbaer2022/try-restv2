                  <span style="font-family: Verdana, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">In 2020, a year already disturbed with COVID-19 became even more disturbed by an odd fluxuation in stock price. GameStop, a company being shorted by the most prestigious Wall Street hedge funds, came to a screeching jump after an enourmous group of teenagers from Reddit invested their stock into the compnay. Reddit, a growing social media platform meant to connect groups of people with similarities, provided a means of communication for the teenagers to collaborate against the big investors shorting GameStop. Some hedge funds were down as much as 53% during this great jump in price. The big investments to make money against the hedge funds shorting GameStop is reffered to as a "Short Squeeze." Apps like Robinhood, investment apps that allow kids to put down money into stocks without any knowledge of how stock and the stock market, allow for these market disasters to occur. Eventually, GameStops stock came crashing down from about $300 to about $40. Tons of people lost money and tons of people made money. Thi odd story of GameStop's rising and crashing stock is one to remember.</span>

                <p>A jury on Thursday evening found Angel Bumpass, who was 13 at the time, guilty of first-degree felony murder and attempt to commit especially aggravated robbery 
                    in the 2009 killing of 68-year-old Franklin Bonner. Mallory Vaughn, her co-defendant, was found not guilty on both counts. Bonner's wife, Linda, was the one who found him lying on the floor, 
                    bound to a kitchen table and chair inside their Washington Hills home on Jan. 16, 2009. He had duct tape around his feet, arms and head, nose and mouth. Suffocation was the cause of death, Hamilton 
                    County Medical Examiner Dr. James Metcalfe later determined. The case had gone cold up until 2018 when Franklin Bonner's relatives called prosecutors asking them to take another look. They did, and 
                    got a match for two fingerprints found at the scene. The match was for Bumpass, who is now 24.</p>
